    Tennis is my second fav game 
</h1>
<p>
    Tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent (singles) or between two teams of two players each (doubles).
     Each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponent's court. 
    The object of the game is to manoeuvre the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return.
