<h1>Baseball is my first fav game</h1>
<p>
    Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams, of nine players each, that take turns batting and fielding. 
    The game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat.
     The objective of the offensive team (batting team) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases
